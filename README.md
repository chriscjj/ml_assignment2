🚀 Data Preprocessing for Machine Learning
📌 Overview
This project focuses on data preprocessing to improve the quality and reliability of data for machine learning models. The dataset undergoes cleaning, transformation, encoding, and scaling to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies, ensuring optimal model performance.

🎯 Objective
The primary goal is to implement a robust data preprocessing system that addresses:
✅ Missing values
✅ Outliers
✅ Inconsistent formatting
✅ Noise in data

📊 Project Workflow
1️⃣ Data Exploration
Listed unique values for each feature
Performed statistical analysis
Renamed columns for clarity
2️⃣ Data Cleaning
Identified and treated missing values
Removed duplicate rows
Handled outliers
Replaced age=0 values with NaN
3️⃣ Data Analysis & Visualization
Filtered data (age > 40 and salary < 5000)
Created charts to visualize relationships
Analyzed the distribution of people across locations
4️⃣ Data Encoding & Feature Scaling
Applied One-Hot Encoding & Label Encoding for categorical variables
Scaled numerical features using StandardScaler & MinMaxScaler
